## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

### **Lab 1: Q-Learning**
- **Description**: Implementations of the Q-Learning algorithm, a model-free RL method for solving problems in discrete state spaces.

---

### **Lab 2: Deep Q-Learning**
- **Description**: Extends Q-Learning to handle high-dimensional state spaces using Deep Neural Networks. This lab covers the fundamentals of Deep Q-Learning, including experience replay and target networks.

---

### **Lab 3: Policy Gradient**
- **Description**: Focuses on policy-based methods, which directly optimize the policy function without using a value function. Includes implementations of REINFORCE and other policy gradient techniques.

---

### **Lab 4: Actor-Critic**
- **Description**: Combines value-based and policy-based methods by training both an actor (policy) and a critic (value function).  
  - **Projects**:
    - `LunarLander-v2-Actor-Critic`: Solving the Lunar Lander problem using the Actor-Critic method.
    - `CartPole-v1-Actor-Critic`: Balancing a pole on a cart using Actor-Critic.
